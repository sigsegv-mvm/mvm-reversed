need header with all the enums we know of
(from libtf2mod, source sdk const.h, etc)

copy over the in-progress bot spy detection code
(make separate dirs for the 20130214 version and the current version)

create skeletons for classes:
tf_revive
bomb hatch
upgrade station


also RE all the nb_, tf_bot_, bot_ cvars

make a GIGANTIC awesome flowgraph, basically a finite state machine diagram
- nodes are the actions
- edges are CHANGE_TO, SUSPEND_FOR, DONE (hrm, that may be hard...)

for each CTFBot action, document whether it is ever used in MvM mode

change enum QueryResponse to existing three-state enum (ThreeState_t) in basetypes.h
convert all scoped enums into unscoped (C style) enums

find/replace:
- TF_TEAM_RED  -> TF_TEAM_PVE_DEFENDERS
- TF_TEAM_BLUE -> TF_TEAM_PVE_INVADERS

use these known names:
CTFBot::m_iSkill -> CTFBot::m_skill
CTFBot::m_nBotAttrs -> CTFBot::m_attributes (not 100% sure)
